class Solution:
    """You are given an array of strings `nums` and an integer `k`. Each string in `nums` represents an integer without leading zeros.

    Return *the string that represents the* `k^{th}` ***largest integer** in* `nums`.

    **Note**: Duplicate numbers should be counted distinctly. For example, if `nums` is `["1","2","2"]`, `"2"` is the first largest integer, `"2"` is the second-largest integer, and `"1"` is the third-largest integer.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: nums = ["3","6","7","10"], k = 4
    Output: "3"
    Explanation:
    The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are ["3","6","7","10"].
    The 4^{th} largest integer in nums is "3".
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: nums = ["2","21","12","1"], k = 3
    Output: "2"
    Explanation:
    The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are ["1","2","12","21"].
    The 3^{rd} largest integer in nums is "2".
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: nums = ["0","0"], k = 2
    Output: "0"
    Explanation:
    The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are ["0","0"].
    The 2^{nd} largest integer in nums is "0".
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^{4}`
    * `1 <= nums[i].length <= 100`
    * `nums[i]` consists of only digits.
    * `nums[i]` will not have any leading zeros.
